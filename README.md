# WebDiP-Web-dizajn-i-programiranje-
Web design and programming project

This project was developed for college course web desing and programming. This was my first encounter with developing web applications so it was made fo rpurpose of learning. Technologies used in this project are: PHP, Smarty, JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, CSS and Ajax.

Interesting this about developing this project is that every single line of code (PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS) was written in Notepad++. So you can imagine what was like learning all these technologies and manually searching for syntax errors :)
